    <span class="post-date">01 Oct 2016</span>

    <p>My name is Yonghao Jin (靳永昊), a senior undergraduate from Department of Physics, <a href="http://en.ustc.edu.cn/">Universiy of Science and Technology of China(USTC)</a>, majored in Applied Physics with concentration in Biophysics.</p>

<!-- ### Background -->
<p>I have a diverse backgrounds in physics, computer science and biology. Having attended a complete undergraduate training in physics,
I acquired a strong quantitative foundation and I am able to use math as a tool to analyze and address complicate problems.
 I was first introduced to the world of computer science when I joined the informatics olympiad team in high school. Having spent nearly seven years in programming, I am adept in many programming contexts. In addition to completing the <code class="highlighter-rouge">National Olympiad Informatics in Province</code> with the first prize, I also wrote programming language interpreters, pipelines for analyzing high throughput sequencing data, physics simulation programs, computer games and so on. My recent project is a <code class="highlighter-rouge">Mathematica</code> language interpreter <a href="https://github.com/jyh1/mmaclone">mmaclone</a>.
 Due to my concentration in biophysics, the required courses in biology covered many interesting topics in life sciences, molecular biology, theoretical neurology and biochemistry, just to name a few. These interesting courses provided me with sufficient knowledge and understanding in biological processes.</p>

<p>I love the feeling of doing research. Currently, I am trying to integrate different sequencing-based probing data to understand the binding preference of RNA binding proteins (RBP) under the supervision of Prof. Kun Qu.
I feel that my backgrounds set me in a unique position to apply statistics, mathematics and computer science to deciphering and interpreting the big data in life sciences.
I am applying for Ph.D. programs in the fall of 2017.</p>
